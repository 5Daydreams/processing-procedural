# Procedural Art is awesome!

I had studied some basics of processing in the past, but I've been feeling compelled to come back to it and do some simple procedural art :)

My idea has been to tinker with a different idea, shape, or concept every two months and catalog everything on folders as time goes on, I'll be providing the code mostly because I don't try to be super neat and organized when making these.

update.: I shifted most of my creative coding shenanigans into rust through a framework called nannou! It is in another repo in my account :)
